This is a very common source of confusion for beginners.  The examples explicitly demonstrate this difference.\n",
            "* **Reverse Sorting:** Includes methods for sorting in reverse order using both `sorted(..., reverse=True)` and `list.sort(reverse=True)`.  The `reverse` keyword argument is the correct way to do this.\n",
            "* **Sorting by Key (Custom Sorting):** Demonstrates how to use the `key` argument of `sorted()` to sort based on a custom criteria.  The example sorts strings by their length.  I added a more complex example with lambda functions to demonstrate how to sort by the second element of a list of tuples. This shows more advanced use.\n",
